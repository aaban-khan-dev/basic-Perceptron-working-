# Perceptron Visualization – AND, OR, XOR

This repository contains a simple Jupyter notebook created while learning
**Perceptron and linear classification**.

The notebook demonstrates:
- How a perceptron works on linearly separable data
- Why XOR cannot be solved using a linear model
- Visual decision boundaries for AND, OR, and XOR datasets

---

## What is covered

- Creation of AND, OR, and XOR datasets
- Training a Perceptron classifier on each dataset
- Visualizing decision boundaries using `mlxtend`
- Understanding the limitation of linear models on XOR problems

---

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn
- mlxtend
- Google Colab
